            <h2>Career Goals</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring Software Engineer with a strong background in IT infrastructure, technical support, and process automation, my career goals are centered around pursuing roles that allow me to leverage my passion for innovative technologies, such as Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Computer Vision, and optimizing data workflows. I am dedicated to solving complex problems and delivering impactful solutions that streamline processes and enhance user experience.</p>

            <h3>Short-Term Goals</h3>
            <p>In the short term, I aim to refine my skills in RPA and Computer Vision by working on real-world projects that integrate these technologies with existing systems. I plan to build on my proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and PowerShell, using these languages to develop automated solutions that drive efficiency and reduce manual effort.</p>
            <p>I also plan to continue my education and gain more hands-on experience with popular RPA tools like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism. This will allow me to contribute meaningfully to projects that require automation, data extraction, and intelligent decision-making processes.</p>

            <h3>Long-Term Goals</h3>
            <p>In the long term, I aspire to take on leadership roles where I can guide teams to design and implement cutting-edge workflows, focusing on business process optimization and automation. I envision myself working with companies at the forefront of technological advancements, creating intelligent systems that not only optimize workflows but also improve the way businesses operate and interact with their customers.</p>
            <p>As my skills grow, I aim to dive deeper into fields such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, combining these with RPA and Computer Vision to solve complex, data-driven challenges. My ultimate goal is to be a key contributor in the development of scalable, automated systems that can transform business operations in dynamic industries.</p>
